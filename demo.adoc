= Quarkus and JHipster Demo

Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native, Java framework for building high-performance web, serverless, and native apps. It uses Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation and aggressive optimizations during the build process. This results in impressive startup performance.

This demo will walk you through the steps to use JHipster, the Quarkus blueprint, and OAuth to build a native and secure full stack application.

**Prerequisites:**

- https://sdkman.io/[Java 11]+
- https://nodejs.org/[Node 14]+
- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker]
- https://cli.okta.com/[Okta CLI]

== Install JHipster and its Quarkus Blueprint

Install JHipster and its Quarkus blueprint using `npm`:

[source,shell]
----
# Install JHipster globally
npm install -g generator-jhipster@6.10.5

# Install the JHipster Quarkus blueprint
npm install -g generator-jhipster-quarkus@1.1.1
----

The `jhipster-quarkus` command is now available as a shortcut for `jhipster --blueprints quarkus`.

== Generate a JHipster Quarkus Application

. Open a terminal and create a directory for your application.

  mkdir jhipster-quarkus && cd jhipster-quarkus
  # oh-my-zsh users: take jhipster-quarkus

. Invoke the `jhipster-quarkus` command to start the application creation wizard.

  jhipster-quarkus

. Choose **OAuth 2.0 / OIDC** for authorization. Select the defaults for everything else.

== Test OAuth 2.0 / OIDC with Keycloak

JHipster Quarkus generates a set of Docker Compose files to help you bootstrap a dev environment. It even imports Keycloak default data with users and apps, so you don't have to.

Keycloak is the default OIDC engine used by JHipster, and you can run it in a Docker container.

. Start a Keycloak container using the command below:

  docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d

. Start your app using Maven:

  ./mvnw

. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your favorite browser and sign in with `admin/admin`.

== Integrate JHipster Quarkus with Okta

. Open a terminal, navigate to your Quarkus app‚Äôs directory, and run `okta register`. If you already an Okta developer account, run `okta login`.

. Run `okta apps create jhipster` in your Quarkus app‚Äôs directory. Accept the defaults when prompted for redirect URIs.

. The Okta CLI will create an `.okta.env` in the current directory. Source the file to set environment variables and start your application with Maven.

  source .okta.env
  ./mvnw
+
TIP: Make sure to add `*.env` to your `.gitignore` so you don‚Äôt accidentally commit your client secret!

. Open an incognito window to `http://localhost:8080` and sign in with Okta.

If you prefer to create your Okta OIDC app in your browser, see the https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/03/08/jhipster-quarkus-oidc#use-oktas-developer-console-to-configure-jhipster[Admin Console instructions] in this demo's related blog post.

== Go Native with Quarkus and GraalVM

. Run Maven‚Äôs `package` command with the `native` profile:

  ./mvnw package -Pnative -DskipTests

. If you‚Äôre not using a JDK with GraalVM included, you‚Äôll get an error:

  [error]: Build step io.quarkus.deployment.pkg.steps.NativeImageBuildStep#build threw an
  exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot find the `native-image` in the
  GRAALVM_HOME, JAVA_HOME and System PATH. Install it using `gu install native-image`

. Solve this by using SDKMAN to install Java 11 with GraalVM.

  sdk install java 21.2.0.r11-grl
  gu install native-image

. Once this process completes, rerun the Maven `package` command.

  ./mvnw package -Pnative -DskipTests

. After roughly three minutes, the native executable should be ready. Start it as a native executable.

  target/*runner

. You can see the memory consumption in MB using the `ps` command:

  ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color jhipster | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'

. Go to `http://localhost:8080` and ensure everything works.

. Enjoy your success! üçæ
